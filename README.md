# Alpuerto-Kriscyrus_LW2_Plant_Species_Image_Classification

## A. Project Overview

### ● Brief Description of the Project

This project focuses on building a simple image classification model using pictures of plants that I personally collected. The images are used as a dataset and trained using Teachable Machine to help the AI recognize different plant categories.

The main goal of this project is to understand how image datasets work, how AI learns from images, and how training results such as accuracy and loss change during the learning process. This is part of my hands-on practice in machine learning and image classification.

### ● Purpose of the Image Classification Model

The purpose of this model is:

- To classify different plant images based on the dataset I created  
- To observe how AI learns through training (accuracy, loss, and predictions)  
- To gain basic experience with machine learning tools like Teachable Machine  

## B. Plant Species Overview

Below are the 20 plant species used in this image classification project. Each species includes one representative image and a short description.

### 1. Venus Flytrap

![Dionaea Muscipula](images/1_Dionaea_muscipula_ch/00001_picturethisa_f89f93e555b8.jpg)

- Common Name: Venus flytrap 
- Scientific Name: Dionaea Muscipula  
- Description: The Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) is a small, carnivorous perennial plant native to boggy, nutrient-poor soils in North/South Carolina. It features a rosette of hinged, jaw-like leaves that snap shut in less than a second to trap insects, triggered by sensitive hairs. The traps, often reddish inside with fringe-like cilia, digest prey to gain nutrients, reopening after 10 days.
